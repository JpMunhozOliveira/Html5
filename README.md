👋 Welcome to the Responsive Web Design Certification! 💻🌐
</h3><br>

Throughout the course, I learned how developers use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design. And the best part is, the course is beginner-friendly, so no matter if you have no prior programming experience, you can easily follow along. 🤗

🐱 The first project I built was a cat photo app, which taught me the basics of HTML and CSS. Next, I learned more advanced techniques like CSS variables by building an adorable penguin 🐧 and also best practices for accessibility by creating a quiz site.

Finally, I learned how to create web pages that respond to different screen sizes using Flexbox to create a stunning photo gallery 🖼️ and Grid to create a magazine article layout 📰.

I highly recommend this course to anyone looking to start or improve their skills in responsive web design. Don't miss the chance to learn from the best teachers! 🚀
